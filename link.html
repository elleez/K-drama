        <h2><center>10 Best Websites to Watch KDrama for Free with English Subtitles</center></h2>
    <h1>VIKI</h1>
    <a href="https://www.viki.com/" target="_blank">Visit VIKI</a>
    <p>Rakuten Viki is the number one site for streaming and watching Kdrama. Being an international platform, it’s the place to go when you’re looking for both old and new Kdramas. This website has English subtitles and other languages like Spanish, French but to mention a few. </p>
   <br>
    <h1>Dramacool</h1>
<a href="https://dramacool.sh/" target="_blank">Visit Dramacool</a>
<p>This is another popular streaming platform for Korean, Japanese and Chinese dramas especially if you need English subtitles. The series on Dramacool are in HD and their servers are super reliable. We love that you can get the most recent dramas on this website and even when its not yet available, you can ask them to add them. Unlike Viki, you dont need to worry about any geographical restrictions. Here you can watch Kdrama and access all other asian shows available on the website. Episodes are also organized so you can stream them individually. </p>
<br>

<h1>WeTV</h1>
<a href="https://wetv.vip/en?language=zh-tw" target="_blank">Visit WeTV</a>
<p>WeTv is a new website where you can watch Kdrama. This platform has been aggregating hundreds of Kdramas and other Asian shows. Being a PUBG-owned site, they also have their own TV shows solely produced by their team. </p>
<br>

<h1>Netflix</h1>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/ph-en/" target="_blank">Visit Netflix</a>
<p>Netflix has several ways for you to find K-dramas on the service and simplifies the process of drilling down to niche categories. There's its "K-Dramas for Beginners" list and an even more specific "K-Dramas about Roommates" section. If you love romance, bromance, fantasies or historical epics, you're in luck. The service offers a mixture of subtitled and dubbed fare.</p>
<br>

<h1>Kocowa</h1>
<a href="https://www.kocowa.com/" target="_blank">Visit Kocowa</a>
<p>You can view some content for free on the app or Kocowa's website without signing up. You can also sign up for Taste24HR, which provides free access to Korean shows and dramas right after they air on South Korea networks MBC, KBS and SBS. The new content streams with and without subtitles and is up for 24 hours. Both options include ads.</p>
<br>

<h1>AsianCrush</h1>
<a href="https://www.asiancrush.com/" target="_blank">Visit AsianCrush</a>
<p>As soon as you open the AsianCrush app on your TV, you'll notice live programming is running right alongside the standard thumbnails. The streaming service has content from South Korea, Japan, China and beyond, and you can watch most of it for free on the ad-supported version.
Its lineup of K-dramas and films can be streamed on-demand or, if you keep up with the schedule, as live feeds. Browse AsianCrush's library according to country, title, genre, on-demand listings, or through one of its special collections such as Korean movies. Popular titles include Boys Over Flowers and Someday. And here, subtitles are king.</p>
<br>

<h1>Amazon Prime Video</h1>
<a href="https://www.primevideo.com/" target="_blank">Visit Amazon Prime Video</a>
<p>If you haven't ventured into Prime Video's catalog lately, it's worth a peek at their Korean entertainment selection. Unfortunately they're not easy to find. While the service has a designated section for foreign content, it's not organized by country. Your best bet is to use specific titles or search terms such as "Korean dramas" or "Korean horror movies" to comb through Prime's titles. Alexa won't necessarily be much help either.
Amazon's streaming service offers a sampling of originals, including The Handmaiden. You can also catch popular titles such as Train to Busan, Café Midnight, and Monster, which are available to watch at no extra cost with a Prime membership. Its K-dramas are spread across genres where you'll find crime-themed shows alongside romantic fantasies. The platform carries both subtitled and dubbed programming.</p>
<br>

<h1>Viu</h1>
<a href="https://www.viu.com/ott/ph" target="_blank">Visit Viu</a>
<p>Viu is a handy app that hosts a ton of Korean dramas for free with ads.
    Unfortunately, Viu is only available in a handful of mostly Asian countries. If you use a VPN (virtual private network) you may be able to access Viu from another country. It can be well worth your time, since Viu has a lot of shows that you may not be able to find elsewhere.
    Viu doesn’t offer a ton of English subtitles for their Korean dramas, so it would best suit advanced learners as a resource for learning Korean.</p>
<br>

<h1> iQIYI</h1>
<a href="https://www.iq.com/?lang=en_us" target="_blank">Visit  iQIYI</a>
<p>Although primarily focused on Chinese TV series, iQIYI also includes some Korean dramas. It’s likely that the platform will bump up its roster over time.
    Some good options include “지리산” (“Mount Jiri”) and “간 떨어지는 동거” (“Frightening Cohabitation” or “My Roommate is a Gumiho”).</p>
<br>

<h1>YouTube</h1>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Visit YouTube</a>
<p>To find them, you can search “Korean dramas” or “Korean dramas full series.” Otherwise, read up on Korean dramas, see which show seems most appealing, and try searching its name in YouTube. Many videos are subtitled in English, though you’ll also find some without subtitles, particularly if you use Korean-language search terms, like 드라마 or 한국드라마 (both phrases refer to Korean dramas).
    Some channels upload content for you! In fact, you can enjoy nearly 50 playlists of Korean dramas with English subtitles courtesy of KBS World TV. With hundreds of episodes to choose from, your Korean learning cup runneth over.</p>
