          <h3><center>KOREAN DRAMA</center></h3>
          <p>A Korean drama (Korean: 한국 드라마; RR: Han-guk deurama), more popularly known as Koreanovela or K-drama, is a type of television series in the Korean language made in South Korea.

            They are popular worldwide, especially in Asia, partially due to the spread of Korean popular culture (the "Korean Wave") and their widespread availability via streaming services, which often offer subtitles in multiple languages. Many K-dramas have been translated internationally, and some of them have had a significant influence in other nations. In other countries, traditional television channels have broadcast some of the most well-known dramas. For example, Dae Jang Geum (2003–04) was sold in 150 countries.[1]
            
            Korean dramas have attracted international attention for their fashion, style, and culture. Their rise in popularity has given a great boost to fashion lines.
            
            The "Korean Wave," or Hallyu, had great impacts on countries around the world. With the wave came Korean TV dramas. "In the late 2000s, South Korea was producing more TV dramas than ever before." (Tilland, 2021) The most successful dramas incorporate skillful combinations of familial affection, sex appeal, and emotional desirability. The demand for K-drama has only increased over the last twenty years after it was nearly destroyed due to Hollywood films, Japanese pop culture, and the financial crisis that hit South Korea in 1997. (Ingyu, 2017) K-dramas continue to gain traction internationally today.
            
            There is a tacit knowledge when it comes to the production of television series in South Korea that appeals to consumers in a unique way. "The working definition of tacit knowledge is the kind of knowledge that is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalizing it." (Ingyu, 2017) K-dramas have an especially large female presence that makes up their following and representation. The female fandom is specifically targeted, and tacit knowledge is applied most effectively in this area. The Korean actors show a wide range of emotions, and many adlib without prompting, even producing genuine tears without assistance.
            
            The acting of women in K-dramas appeals to women universally, showing the struggles that pertain only to women. Women in these television series often assume typically male-dominated professions, and they appeal to all women who want to bring down the image of traditional values and male-dominated communities. K-dramas are successful when women can break free of traditional roles and embrace freedom. The men in K-dramas have begun to present a more fluid nature of representation, which challenges the gender roles typically expected of men. Rather than focusing on being "macho" or "manly," men adopt more feminine and androgynous looks in order to cater to female fans. There is a great focus on the beauty techniques used, ranging from makeup all the way to cosmetic surgeries. The androgyny in K-drama, as well as K-pop, is a common phenomenon and draws the attention of women through global targeting.
            
            The attention K-dramas receive has also inspired many to visit South Korea. According to a report published in The Korea Herald, more than half of the tourists that visited South Korea came after watching Korean dramas. ("Impact of Korean Dramas on the World", 2022) Most Korean dramas are filmed on location, highlighting the beauty of the country and drawing in more tourists (e.g., Crash Landing on You, which was filmed in Switzerland and South Korea). These TV series can also be described as emotionally addictive and are universally appealing due to the relatability of the content. These universal themes include love, family, and personal growth. "The characters in K-dramas are often complex and multi-layered, making them more interesting and engaging to watch." (Sejong, 2023)</p>
